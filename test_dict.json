    "04_ASSESSMENT": "/ PLAN:????54 yo man with UC (s/p total abdominal colectomy/end ileostomy) and with history of (L) lower back melanoma (initially diagnosed in 2000 and s/p wide excision with negative SLN biopsy) who began to notice a subcutaneous nodule in the (L) upper back in 2013/05, between the site of the original primary melanoma and the (L) axillary nodal basin where he had received a SLN biopsy. Excisional biopsy of the (L) upper back nodule (2013/07/19; OSH) showed metastatic malignant melanoma. Patient was referred to surgical oncology for a potenial additional surgical treatment on 2013/08/30. On 2013/11/05, patient received excision of (L) flank recurrent melanoma (2 cm radial margins and to deep muscle fascia) and sentinel lymph node biopsies of (L) inferior flank and (L) axilla. Pathology showed residual melanoma in the (L) flank present as multiple foci, present at margins. Deep margin sample continued to have several foci of metastatic melanoma. 1 of 5 L axillary sentinel nodes was positive for metastatic melanoma. In 2013/11, patient was explained the pathology findings and potential for additional surgery versus systemic therapy was discussed. Patient deferred medical and surgical options and sought alternative therapy.?  ?  Patient returned to DFCI in 2014/02 and noted to have disease progression to Stage IV. In 2014/03, patient was started on Dabrafenib + Trametinib systemic therapy. The therapy was discontinued in 2015/03 due to appearance of new subcutaneous lesions consistent with disease progression and significant side effects. On 2015/03/11, patient was started on Protocol 14-507 (Nivolumab + Ipilimumab). However due to continued disease progression in the (L) flank (despite lack of evidence of new sites of disease) and severe systemic toxicity, the combination Nivo+Ipi therapy was stopped in 2015/05. ?On 2015/05/27, patient discussed palliativeresection of the enlarging (L) flank lesion with surgical oncology and proceeded with resection of (L) flank metastatic melanoma at the BWH (2015/06/16). Pathology showed two adjacent soft tissue metastases, measuring 30 and 45 mm. Patient continued follow-up and interval scans with medical oncology. Re-staging scans 2016/03/02 were negative for disease progression, however patient reported a new palpable nodule near the (L) flank surgical scar. On 2016/03/28, interval exam confirmed a firm nodule at the (L) flank surgical site; surgical resection of the isolated mass was scheduled. However, in early 2016/04, patient reported the appearance of a second subcutaneous lesion, anterior to the first lesion. Surgery was postponed. The patient opted for systemic therapy and was re-initiated on Nivolumab in 2016/04. Interval scans in 2016/06 demonstrated disease stability but in 2016/07, patient again noticed enlargement of the (L) flank scar-associated subcutaneous metastases with increased pain symptoms.    In 2016/08, patient was evaluated for enlarging, symptomatic lesion on the (L) flank. Patient opted for palliative excision with use of the specimen for vaccine trial. On 2016/09/06, palliative resection of (L) flank metastatic melanoma was performed at the BWH. Pathology confirmed melanoma metastasis. Initial post-operative recovery was uneventful. Patient returned to clinic today for interval follow-up due to intermittent surgical site pain with movement and position changes.    On exam, the (L) flank surgical site had a healed scar. However, new subcutaneous nodules were palpable on the (L) flank, separate from the recent surgical site. The exam was consistent with progression of regional disease. Clinical exam was negative for surgical site recurrence, however. The surgical site pain with movement/position changes appeared to be as expected for routine post-operative findings. I discussed limitingactivity for an additional 3-4 weeks to assist with wound healing and pain control.    Approximately 20 minutes were spent with the patient, more than half of which was devoted to discussion and counseling. All questions were answered. Patient will follow-up with medical oncology regarding the vaccine trial.        Charles H. Yoon, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S.

    "03_DEAR_CONCORD_HEALTH": "    I saw Dana Clare last Monday (11/2/2015) in neurology clinic at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. As you know, his main issues are with mental status. Since his visit, his EEG results have returned, and they demonstrate ongoing cortical irritability. He is currently taking Keppra 1g BID. His mental status issues may be related to undertreatment of his cortical irritability, and I would like to start an additional medication at this point. The medication is lamotrigine, and it is very well tolerated in older individuals, as it is not known to cause any alteration in mental status or drowsiness. The major adverse effect of this medication is a severe rash (Stevens Johnson) within the first few weeks but only when the medication is not titrated slowly. For this reason, it takes several weeks to uptitrate to a therapeutic dose, but this will ensure minimal to no risk of SJS. I am including uptitration instructions as a prescription and will also detail them here:   Start with 25 mg tabs. Take 1 tab PO QD x 14 days, then increase to 1 tab PO BID x 14 days, then increase to 2 tabs PO BID x 14 days. Once this prescription has finished (6 weeks from starting), switch to 100mg tabs and give 1 tab PO BID thereafter. Once he has been on this medication for a couple of months, we will reassess his neurologic status and make further adjustments as necessary. He should therefore follow up with me at the end of January.    I have also received his lumbar puncture results (which I performed at theappointment) and they are stable, showing no evidence of ongoing infection. Please call if you have questions or concerns.    Sincerely,    Jennifer Lyons, M.D.",

Of note, patient with h/o RCC with metastatic lesions in 2015 to brain s/p resection 7/10/2015 with course complicated by post-op meningitis/ventriculitis, and waxing and waning mental status since. He was transiently hypotensive to SBP of 90s and had a fever to 102F, and we were initially concerned for sepsis and treated empirically with cefepime.He had a clear UA without growth from cultures. A brain MRI was suggestive of ventriculitis vs metastatic disease. A flouro-guided LP was performed, showing glucose 74, protein 119, 310 RBC and 280 WBC. ID was consulted, and this was felt to be possibly c/w infection (was drawn i/s/o recent cipro and on cefepime). There were rare GPCs on gram stain; bacterial and fungal cultures of CSF did not grow. He was started on vanc/ceftaz (D1 = 9/14). Notably, he had a recent hospitalization in mid August with similar presentation, was treated with vanc for CSF GS showing coag neg. Staph. He was started on dexamethasone with bactrim PCP prophylaxis. His mental status waxed and waned and he became increasingly somnolent, and neurology was consulted. An EEG and long term monitoring showed parietal discharges (despite pt being on keppra 500 BID), and keppra was incrased to 1g BID with little change in his mental staus. Neurosurgery was consulted and felt that there was no evidence of obstruction and no surgical intervention indicated. His mental status was waxing and waning at discharge. Ceftaz was stopped on 9/20 and then restarted shortly thereafter because the team felt that it was declining.  He continued on vancomycin and ceftaz for a planned four week course. Repeat EEG on 9/30/15 did not show any seizure activity and keppra dose was decreased to 750 mg BID to see if his mental status would improve.    # Nutritional status:  Pt was evaluated by speech and swallow given AMS here, and he deemed unsafe for POs given episodes of somnolence and throat-clearing after eating. He was made NPO and maintained on D5 LR @50 mL/hr. Metabolic support was consulted and placed a G tube on 9/23. He tolerated G tube feeding up to 100 ml/hr. Nutrition was consulted.  He was started on a multivitamin, thiamine, foltate, calcium, and vitamin D.    # SVT  Pt had new sudden on set SVT 9/17 with rates to 160s (apparently notsymptomatic, but difficult to assess based on pt's mental status), that  responded to diltiazem 2mg. He had no ischemic changes on EKG, non-elevated troponin. He remained in SR since, with bradycardia down to 40s while sleeping.    # Metastatic RCC to brain s/p right parietal craniotomy for resection of an intraventricular tumor  Pt is followed by Dr. Channing Yu. Most recently on pazopanib. S/p WBRT from 01/02/2015-01/15/2015 (Dr. Paul Nguyen). Underwent frontal craniotomy for tumor resection on 7/10, which was complicated by post-operative ventriculitis (admitted on 07/23/2015 low-grade fevers, elevated WBC, and altered mental status on admission. CSF grew rare gram positive cocci). Head CT this admission showed no changes since prior. MRI brain revealed likely ventriculitis but could not rule out additional metastatic disease, and repeat imaging showed possible interval improvement in occipital edema but ongoing ventricle enhancement.

Brigham and Women’s Hospital        Department of Neurology        45 Francis Street        Boston, MA 02115?  ?  ??  ?  Dr. ???Lilian Mikael, MD  Suite 201  Concord MA 01742  781-207-2434??  ?  Dear Dr. ??Lilian Mikael, MD??,?  ?  I had the pleasure of seeing ??Dana Clare?? (MRN: ??10580959??, DOB: ??2/10/1954??) in Neurology Clinic today for consultation regarding ventriculitis. Dana Clare? is a 61 y.o.?? ??male? with a history of ?renal cell carcinoma with hemorrhagic met to the R thalamus extending into the lateral ventricle in 7/2015 who is s/p surgical removal of the metastatic focus with meningoventriculitis complicating the procedure. The etiology of the inflammatory reaction is not entirely clear, as there were 2650 WBCs with 95% poly predominance with glucose of 26 and protein of 441 (7/23/2015); no lactate was evaluated; the gram stain showed GPCs but the cultures did not grow anything, making the differential chemical reaction with contamination of CSF vs Staph meningoventriculitis, which was the presumption. Initial plan was for 4 weeks of vancomycin; he was readmitted in August with ongoing encephalopathy. Repeat LP had improved WBC counts and MRI showed ongoing ventriculitis. After the initial 4 week course, per record, this was restarted for a second 4 week course in September, and this has been stopped at some point in the last 2 weeks (he is no longer on it now but was as of his 10/15 visit); he has been on Bactrim SS since 10/2 per nursing records with him today. Multiple EEGs have been performed for concern of seizure; these have shown multifocal areas of sharp waves and poorly organized background but never any overt seizure. He has just completed a 3 day EEG at his facility for concern of new overt NC seizures. He is on Keppra at this time (1g BID). He comes today after repeat MRI 3 days ago (that shows ongoing but resolving ventriculitis) andneurological evaluation. He is brought by ambulance and I spoke to his son, who is in school full time.   Overall, the patient has been stable clinically but has not had much improvement cognitively. He does not speak or follow commands. He is fed by PEG. His renal cell carcinoma treatment is on hold. He has not been febrile.   ?Dex taper finished 10/31.   Review of systems: As above, otherwise negative across 10 systems. ?  ??Problems  Patient Active Problem List   Diagnosis   • Low back pain   • Sleep apnea   • Malignant tumor of prostate (HCC)   • Obesity   • Eczema   • Seasonal affective disorder (HCC)   • Hypercholesterolemia   • Plantar fasciitis   • Asthma   • Chronic kidney disease, stage III (moderate)   • Weakness   • Shoulder joint pain   • Kidney cancer, primary, with metastasis from kidney to other site (HCC)   • Brain tumor (HCC)   • Obstructive hydrocephalus   • Respiratory failure (HCC)   • Encephalopathy   • Intracranial hemorrhage (HCC)   • Meningitis   • Hypertension   • Altered mental status   • Fever   • Leukocytosis   • AKI (acute kidney injury) (HCC)   • Altered mental status   • Pain   • Hyperglycemia   • Neoplasm of brain (HCC)   • Delirium   • Somnolence   • Pure hypercholesterolemia   • Malignant neoplasm of kidney, except pelvis (HCC)   • Other malignant neoplasm without specification of site (HCC)   • Nutritional marasmus (HCC)   ??  ?  ??Medications??  ?Heparin 5K IU TID (2PM dose held today)  Bactrim SS QD  Colace  simva 40mg QD  keppra 1g BID  Famotidine 20mg QD  Vitamin D  Insulin  proair    ??Allergies??  Wasp venom and Ampicillin sodium  ?   The family history is noncontributory  ?  Social History: The patient lives in a facility with 24H care.   ?  PHYSICAL EXAM:?  ??GEN: NAD. Interactive. Well developed.?  Skin: No rashes or bruising.?  HEENT: NC/AT, sclera/conjunctiva WNL, MMM, OP clear.?  Neck: Supple.   ?CV: RRR. No carotid bruits. ?Extr: Warm and well perfused, without CCE. ?  ?  Neuro: ?  The patient comes on a stretcher and is unable to ambulate. He is awake and alert and will make eye contact but is overall severely abulic. There are minimal spontaneous movements??? but he does use both hands purposefully on occasion. He will tell me his name is Dana and his son's name is Jonathan. He will follow some simple commands (close your eyes, squeeze hands, wiggle toes). His face is symmetric and pupils are 3.5-->2.5 OS and 3.0-->2.0 OD. BTT bilaterally. Palate is symmetric and tongue is midline. EOMI. Tone is somewhat increased throughout. Able to hold arms briefly antigravity if placed there but does not participate in MRC testing. Will not hold legs antigravity off stretcher. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric throughout; toes are both down. There is a stimulus induced and action tremor in the BUE of low amplitude and high frequency. When I spoke to his son, I gave the patient the phone, and he took it up to his ear, listened, did not say anything, and then returned the phone to me after about 30 seconds.   ?  ASSESSMENT and IMPRESSION: ?  ?61M with h/o metastatic renal cell CA to brain with presumed staph ventriculitis complicating resection. His exam now is notable for abulia. With arousal he complains of pain and will utter one or two words but otherwise has minimal speech output, even when listening to his son. Overall, his picture seems consistent with survivor of ventriculitis (be it chemical or bacterial), and on my 90 minute interaction with him there did not seem to be seizure activity. I will await the results of the prolonged EEG, and if this has improved or is stable would favor decreasing the Keppra dose initially with intent to wean to see if his mental status improves. Cognitive rehabilitation will benefit this patient.    His imaging did show ongoing abnormalities and after discussion withvarious teams, I repeated the LP in the office today. Consent was obtained from his son Jonathan by phone (witnessed by EMT). His most recent platelets were in the 130s and INR was 1.1. He has never had TCP or coagulopathy and is on no anticoagulation (PPX heparin was held at 2PM today, as well). He was positioned sitting up with the help of 3 EMTs and the L3/L4 space (there is surgical scar from L3-S1) was entered with a sterile spinal needle in a sterile fashion on the first pass and about 3 cc fluid were recovered (fluid was initially clear but the patient had movement that resulted in the fluid turning pink-tinged) and sent for cell count/diff, glucose/TP, cytology, gram stain and micro. There were no complications.    I will see the patient back in about 1 month if we decide to taper the Keppra based on the EEG.   ?  Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. ?  ?  I spent greater than 50% of the 90-minute visit in education and counseling of the patient and his caretakers.  ?  ?  Sincerely, ?  ?  ?  Jennifer Lyons, M.D.?  ?  ?",

Please see initial ID consult on 7/24 for full details. Patient was discharged to rehab on vanco with a planned course of 4 weeks which would have ended on 8/20/15. Mental status however never returned back to normal. Patient was still minimally responsive with waxing and waning mental status. He was re-admitted for worsening mental status, AKI (vanco trough was supratherapeuttic) on 8/16/15 . Repeat LP showed 2450 RBC, TNC 6 total protein 91 (better than before was 441) glucose normal, bacterial cx neg, HSV/VZV/ toxo neg. Repeat MRI showed grossly stable postoperative changes with scattered  parenchymal lesions. Patient was briefly on ceftaz that was subsequently discontinued after LP results. Patient was discharged to rehab was re-admitted on 9/11 with fever, somnolence, was minimally responsive. He was treated at rehab for UTI with cipro. MRI brain showed ventriculitis. LP on 9/13 revealed 310 RBC and 10 TNC, protein 118, normal glucose, cultures were no growth. Patient was treated empirically with 4 weeks of vanco/ceftaz without improvement in mental status.Patient was seen today for follow up. He is minimally responsive, sometimes nods yes or no, doesn't open his eyes. His mental status waxes and wanes. No reported fevers.    ?   ?

Please see initial ID consult on 7/24 for full details. Patient was discharged to rehab on vanco with a planned course of 4 weeks which would have ended on 8/20/15. Mental status however never returned back to normal. Patient was still minimally responsive with waxing and waning mental status. He was re-admitted for worsening mental status, AKI (vanco trough was supratherapeuttic) on 8/16/15 . Repeat LP showed 2450 RBC, TNC 6 total protein 91 (better than before was 441) glucose normal, bacterial cx neg, HSV/VZV/ toxo neg. Repeat MRI showed grossly stable postoperative changes with scatteredparenchymal lesions. Patient was briefly on ceftaz that was subsequently discontinued after LP results. Patient was discharged to rehab was re-admitted on 9/11 with fever, somnolence, was minimally responsive. He was treated at rehab for UTI with cipro. MRI brain showed ventriculitis. LP on 9/13 revealed 310 RBC and 10 TNC, protein 118, normal glucose, cultures were no growth. Patient is currently on vanco/ceftaz with plan to treat for 4 weeks (ending 10/14) without improvement in mental status. Etiology of ventriculitis/change in mental status is unclear. Patient received prolonged empiric antibacterial therapy without any improvement in mental status. The 2 most recent LPs were not suggestive of bacterial ventriculitis (very low TNC count , normal glucose). HSV/VZV/Toxoplasma/crypto ag in CSF were negative. EEG showed focal cortical irritability and moderate dysfunction over the R parietal region in the setting of moderate bilateral dysfunction and encephalopathy.  Abnormal FLAIR could be lagging behind after treatment of ventriculitis  Would recommend:  1/ Continue vanco/ceftaz to finish 4 weeks course then D/C   2/ Consider repeating LP one week off antimicrobials and send for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial cultures as well as HSV and VZV PCR. Would also send for cytology  3/ Repeat MRI brain in 2-3 weeks.  4/ Refer to Dr. Jennifer Lyons (Neuro ID) for her input.    D/w Dr. Yu.    ?   ?   Nicolas C.
