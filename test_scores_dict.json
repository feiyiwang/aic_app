M with history of renal cell carcinoma status post resection in 2000 (pT2) and Gleason 4+3 prostate cancer status post radiation and hormonal therapy who presents with worsening balance and falls and was found to have multiple brain lesions including a 5.5 cm mass arising from the thalamus along with multiple chest lesions, biopsy proven renal cell carcinoma. He has received whole brain irradiation.    He was recently hospitalized for confusion and somnolence on 7/7/15 for metastatic brain lesion associated with hemorrhage and obstructing CSF flow, and this improved with EVD insertion. No vessel was identified forvascular intervention on angiogram. He was discharged and returned for confusion and somnolence and treated for post-operative meningitis, with few Gram-positive cocci found in CSF.    His mental status appears much improved from the marked confusion/somnolence/encephalopathy described during hospitalizations. His short-term memory which was mildly impaired before appears to be slightly worsened from the previous clinic visit with me on 6/24/15.    He has not received pazopanib since 7/6/15. The thoracic lesions were responding to this treatment previously. There has been resection of the brain lesions with surgery (and previously whole brain irradiation).Will consider reinitiating treatment with pazopanib with careful surveillance of metastatic sites after meningitis treatment is confirmed to be completed.

This mental status, along with impairments including decreased functional strength, impaired seated balance, and poor safety awareness, are impacting his ability to perform all aspects of functional mobility. Mr. Clare will benefit from skilled PT while at BWH to address the above impairments and improve his functional mobility.

Please see initial ID consult on 7/24 for full details. Patient was discharged to rehab on vanco with a planned course of 4 weeks which would have ended on 8/20/15. Mental status however never returned back to normal. Patient was still minimally responsive with waxing and waning mental status. He was re-admitted for worsening mental status, AKI (vanco trough was supratherapeuttic) on 8/16/15 . Repeat LP showed 2450 RBC, TNC 6 total protein 91 (better than before was 441) glucose normal, bacterial cx neg, HSV/VZV/ toxo neg. Repeat MRI showed grossly stable postoperative changes with scatteredparenchymal lesions. Patient was briefly on ceftaz that was subsequently discontinued after LP results. Patient was discharged to rehab was re-admitted on 9/11 with fever, somnolence, was minimally responsive. He was treated at rehab for UTI with cipro. MRI brain showed ventriculitis. LP on 9/13 revealed 310 RBC and 10 TNC, protein 118, normal glucose, cultures were no growth. Patient is currently on vanco/ceftaz with plan to treat for 4 weeks (ending 10/14) without improvement in mental status. Etiology of ventriculitis/change in mental status is unclear. Patient received prolonged empiric antibacterial therapy without any improvement in mental status. The 2 most recent LPs were not suggestive of bacterial ventriculitis (very low TNC count , normal glucose). HSV/VZV/Toxoplasma/crypto ag in CSF were negative. EEG showed focal cortical irritability and moderate dysfunction over the R parietal region in the setting of moderate bilateral dysfunction and encephalopathy.  Abnormal FLAIR could be lagging behind after treatment of ventriculitis  Would recommend:  1/ Continue vanco/ceftaz to finish 4 weeks course then D/C   2/ Consider repeating LP one week off antimicrobials and send for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial cultures as well as HSV and VZV PCR.

The results of the LP are more consistent with blood in the CSF than traumatic tap (xanthochromia, high RBCs in subsequent tubes).  The MRI finding of layering intraventricular fluid was discussed extensively in neuroradiology conference today - could signify inflammation and/or debris post-surgery/post-infection, but can also be consistent with old blood in the ventriclar system.  The patient has known IVH from prior hospitalizations and per current imaging appears to be stable.Furthermore, blood was not seen on recent head CT which would support that the IVH is subacute/chronic.  The patient has had prior assessment for vascular malformation -- CTA and cerebral angiogram performed in July found unremarkable arterial circulation.   The patient's AMS is improving and currently felt to be similar to his pre-op status.  Today he continues to have elevated creatinine and exhibits mild asterixis on exam.  No infectious source has yet been identified.  It is likely that the patient's AMS is 2/2 AKI in the setting of supratherapeutic vanc troughs.  Medications could be another contributing factor -- namely Levetiracitam and Prednisone.  The patient is now more than one month out of surgery and denies hx of seizure -- would be reasonable to begin tapering Levetiracitam if EEG is ok.",

Symptoms and imaging are certainly c/f recurrence of CNS infection. While CSF does not show an abundance of TNCs, it is important to note that this LP was done after having been on cipro in the outpatient setting and at least two days of cefepime in the inpatient setting. His UA is not convincing for UTI, thus we would attribute his presenting symptoms of fever, AMS, and leukocytosis to a likely ventriculitis.   Given that he was instrumented in July, we would cover skin flora as well as nosocomial pathogens, including staph and Pseudomonas. This could also represent persistent infection with CoNS, which was thought to be the culprit organism during his admission in late July.RECOMMENDATIONS:",

I personally reviewed the CT scans of the  abdomen, and pelvis performed on Mr. Desantis. I reviewed the images and discussed the report at length with the patient.   I reviewed the scans with the attending radiologist personally as well.   I discussed the case with the attending surgical oncologist Dr. Charles Yoon in detail.   It appears that there are 2 sites of disease in fairly close proximity, one in the left lateral, the other one in the left posterior chest wall. Clinically the left lateral chest wall mass is palpable.   We had a lengthy discussion about treatment considerations in light of these findings. We discussed the potential of palliative surgery for the left lateral chest wall lesions. Palliative radiation is a theoretical consideration however surgical removal would be preferred if the patient's so desires because of discomfort.   We discussed the potential of enrollment on protocol 12\u20133 06 using WDVAX, a scaffold vaccine which is generated from resected autologous tumor tissue. I explained in detail the rationale of this trial, the treatment plan and expected toxicities. I explained that the scaffold is a novel material that in conjunction with the cytokine GM-CSF attracts antigenpresenting cells to the implanted tumor cells with the intent to generate a melanoma directed immune response.   We also discussed the possibility of using the oncolytic herpesvirus T VAC, which was recently approved for the treatment of unresectable stage III and 4 M1 a melanoma.   We discussed the potential synergy between the WD VAX vaccine as well as T VAC with the anti-PD-1 therapy that David has received over the last several months.   We will treat with nivolumab today and there would will spend the next several days deliberating about the options were discussed today. A consent form for protocol 12\u20133 06 was given to the patient.   The visit today lasted more than 40 minutes. More than 80 percent of the time has been spent on discussing the topics as described above and counseling.      Patrick A.

I personally reviewed the CT scans of the  abdomen, and pelvis performed on Mr. Desantis. I reviewed the images and discussed the report at length with the patient.   I reviewed the scans with the attending radiologist personally as well.   I discussed the case with the attending surgical oncologist Dr. Charles Yoon in detail.   It appears that there are 2 sites of disease in fairly close proximity, one in the left lateral, the other one in the left posterior chest wall. Clinically the left lateral chest wall mass is palpable.   We had a lengthy discussion about treatment considerations in light of these findings. We discussed the potential of palliative surgery for the left lateral chest wall lesions. Palliative radiation is a theoretical consideration however surgical removal would be preferred if the patient's so desires because of discomfort.

We discussed the next step was on trial in detail. I informed the patient that the melanoma cells need to be cultured due to small amount of melanoma cells that was harvested from the resected tumor specimen. We spoke about the timeline and the treatments with WDVAX including the surgeries and how they are done in detail.   Regarding his fatigue there is no clearly apparent explanation. He did not have blood work today. His last administration of PD-1 inhibitor has been more than 6 weeks ago making a direct intrinsic side effect less likely although not impossible. His melanoma burden is low also arguing against the fatigue being directly related to his cancer. Of course it could be a multifactorial etiology including his most recent surgery and the recovery period.   He was also treated for Lyme disease last month and had his Lyme titers rechecked just earlier this week\u2013awaiting results.   We will arrange for laboratory evaluation including endocrine labs (TSH, T4, ACTH, cortisol, testosterone)   He will follow-up as per protocol.   The visit today lasted more than 30 minutes.

I personally reviewed the CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed on Mr. Desantis. I reviewed the images and discussed the report at length with the patient.   Unfortunately the scans from earlier today demonstrates substantial increase in disease burden almost certainly explaining his substantially increased pain.   We discussed next steps. Given his dehydration, weakness and failure to thrive as well as ongoing pain I suggest that he be hospitalized. He has not taken his oxycodone as prescribed because he is concerned of not being able to function. I emphasized the importance of adequate pain control.   His melanoma has been responsive to BRAF/MEK inhibition but was stopped 2 years ago when he had chronic toxicity. In my opinion restarting these drugs affords him the best chance to reduce the size of the tumors and we will therefore work on reinitiating this regimen.   - IVF  - pain control (oxycodone or dilaudid)  - consider pamidronate or zometa  - would hold off with radiation consult since targeted therapy should work quickly.

I personally reviewed the CT scans of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed on Mr. Desantis. I reviewed the images and discussed the report at length with the patient.   The scans demonstrate stable disease with slight decrease in tumor size. There is no evidence for new metastatic disease.   Given the clinical benefit from the nivolumab we will continue with nivolumab at 2 mg/kg per kilograms even every 2 weeks. We will plan for restaging scans in 8-12 weeks depending on clinical findings (i.e. the left flank nodule)   Regarding his weight loss I encouraged high caloric diet with less emphasis on a well-balanced diet. I encouraged him to take it easier with his physical exercise. He of note had been doing triathlons where he loses a lot of calories that he can then not replete because of his anorexia. He is currently not interested in appetite stimulants which I think is reasonable as a first step to attempt higher intake of calories. We discussed the dietary issues at length.   Regarding his arthralgias he is followed by Dr. Gedmintas from rheumatology. He will continue on the prednisone 10 mg daily.   He'll be seen back in clinic in 2 weeks for the next treatment with nivolumab.Mr. Desantis verbalized understanding and was in agreement with the above plan. he was able to ask all of his questions and was satisfiedwith the responses given.  All of his concerns were discussed to the best of my knowledge.      The visit today lasted more than 25 minutes. More than 50 percent of the time has been spent on discussing the topics as described above and counseling.      Patrick A.

Excisional biopsy of the (L) upper back nodule (2013/07/19; OSH) showed metastatic malignant melanoma. Patient was referred to surgical oncology for a potenial additional surgical treatment on 2013/08/30. On 2013/11/05, patient received excision of (L) flank recurrent melanoma (2 cm radial margins and to deep muscle fascia) and sentinel lymph node biopsies of (L) inferior flank and (L) axilla. Pathology showed residual melanoma in the (L) flank present as multiple foci, present at margins. Deep margin sample continued to have several foci of metastatic melanoma. 1 of 5 L axillary sentinel nodes was positive for metastatic melanoma. In 2013/11, patient was explained the pathology findings and potential for additional surgery versus systemic therapy was discussed. Patient deferred medical and surgical options and sought alternative therapy.?  ?  Patient returned to DFCI in 2014/02 and noted to have disease progression to Stage IV. In 2014/03, patient was started on Dabrafenib + Trametinib systemic therapy. The therapy was discontinued in 2015/03 due to appearance of new subcutaneous lesions consistent with disease progression and significant side effects. On 2015/03/11, patient was started on Protocol 14-507 (Nivolumab + Ipilimumab). However due to continued disease progression in the (L) flank (despite lack of evidence of new sites of disease) and severe systemic toxicity, the combination Nivo+Ipi therapy was stopped in 2015/05. ?On 2015/05/27, patient discussed palliativeresection of the enlarging (L) flank lesion with surgical oncology and proceeded with resection of (L) flank metastatic melanoma at the BWH (2015/06/16). Pathology showed two adjacent soft tissue metastases, measuring 30 and 45 mm. Patient continued follow-up and interval scans with medical oncology. Re-staging scans 2016/03/02 were negative for disease progression, however patient reported a new palpable nodule near the (L) flank surgical scar. On 2016/03/28, interval exam confirmed a firm nodule at the (L) flank surgical site; surgical resection of the isolated mass was scheduled. However, in early 2016/04, patient reported the appearance of a second subcutaneous lesion, anterior to the first lesion. Surgery was postponed. The patient opted for systemic therapy and was re-initiated on Nivolumab in 2016/04. Interval scans in 2016/06 demonstrated disease stability but in 2016/07, patient again noticed enlargement of the (L) flank scar-associated subcutaneous metastases with increased pain symptoms.   In 2016/08, patient was evaluated for enlarging, symptomatic lesion on the (L) flank. Patient opted for palliative excision with use of the specimen for vaccine trial. On 2016/09/06, palliative resection of (L) flank metastatic melanoma was performed at the BWH. Pathology confirmed melanoma metastasis. Initial post-operative recovery was uneventful. Patient returned to clinic today for interval follow-up due to intermittent surgical site pain with movement and position changes.   On exam, the (L) flank surgical site had a healed scar. However, new subcutaneous nodules were palpable on the (L) flank, separate from the recent surgical site. The exam was consistent with progression of regional disease. Clinical exam was negative for surgical site recurrence, however. The surgical site pain with movement/position changes appeared to be as expected for routine post-operative findings. I discussed limitingactivity for an additional 3-4 weeks to assist with wound healing and pain control.   Approximately 20 minutes were spent with the patient, more than half of which was devoted to discussion and counseling. All questions were answered. Patient will follow-up with medical oncology regarding the vaccine trial.      Charles H. Yoon, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S.  Surgical Oncology  Brigham and Women's Hospital  Dana Farber Cancer Institute",
